# Covid19-TimeSeries

## Description
COVID-19, a global pandemic, has significantly impacted lives worldwide. 
Scientists believe that a lack of advanced systems to track and predict 
the virus's spread contributed to its rapid expansion. To address this, 
they propose using artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning models, 
to forecast daily COVID-19 cases. This information can help governments make 
informed decisions about travel restrictions and other public health measures.

In this project, we will build a deep learning model using a 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the number
of new COVID-19 cases in Malaysia based on the previous 30 days of data.
